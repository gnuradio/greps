authoring a new GRIPE]

- Original Author: [First Last <first.last@host.tld>]

- Status: Draft [GRIPEs are always submitted as "Draft"]

History:
- 15-Oct-2016: Initial Draft

[Dates are in format: DD-MON-YYYY]
[Not every change needs to go into the history, because that's also in the git
history, but major changes should be put here just to make it convenient for the
reader]

[There may be multiple original authors]

## Abstract

[Approx. 200 words. Should convey all the high-level ideas]

## Copyright / License

[Pick a license and tell us who the copyright owner is. Unlike code, this does
not need be assigned to the FSF, and authors can keep copyright. GRIPE 0000
chose the CC-BY-ND license because we don't want modified copies of it all over
the place]

## Motivation

[More elaborate section on the reasoning, but not necessarily the details of
implementation]

## Description

[Everything interesting comes here. Use level-3 and level-4 headers as you see
fit.]
[This section should contain everything necessary for anyone to understand what
needs to be done]
